# Functional Programming

Goals:
* Understand Functional Programming, train my brain to think functional but only when it is needed.
* Use scala natively with Spark. Possibly expose reusable capabilities to be used with my stack
* Make a proper Azure CosmosDb example with spark

### Functional Programming Principles using Scala
* [Subtyping And Generics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/lecture/KvSC2/lecture-4-3-subtyping-and-generics) [x]
* [Variance](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/lecture/dnreZ/lecture-4-4-variance-optional) [x]
* [Decomposition](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/lecture/8ZaPo/lecture-4-5-decomposition) [x]
* [Pattern Matching](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/lecture/cdHAM/lecture-4-6-pattern-matching) [x]
* [Lists](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/lecture/TFjsY/lecture-4-7-lists) [x]
* [More Functions on List](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/lecture/XYlER/lecture-5-1-more-functions-on-lists) [x]
* [Pairs and Tuples](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/lecture/0uFfe/lecture-5-2-pairs-and-tuples) [x]
* [Implicit Parameters](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/lecture/82wi4/lecture-5-3-implicit-parameters) [x]
* [Higher-Order List Functions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/lecture/UWSpZ/lecture-5-4-higher-order-list-functions) [x]
* [Reduction of Lists](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/lecture/UpWlj/lecture-5-5-reduction-of-lists) [x]
* [Other Collections](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/lecture/d0fdt/lecture-6-1-other-collections) [x]
* [Combinatorial Search](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/lecture/JIPKx/lecture-6-2-combinatorial-search-and-for-expressions) [x]
* [Combinatorial Search Example](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/lecture/H3cKk/lecture-6-3-combinatorial-search-example) [x]
* [Maps](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/lecture/weqsE/lecture-6-4-maps)

* Might need some time to understand foldLeft and foldRight deeply
